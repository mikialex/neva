# shadowGraph

ShadowGraph is an experimental shader graph implementation based on webgl;

By design, graphics developer can use ShadowGraph create reuseable shader component, combine them in a graph node editor, view shader effect interactively. CodeGen to / Parse from different target, threejs material or babylon material, glsl or hlsl. 

In long term roadmap, I plan extent node flow based development to support generative graphic art, even general generative creative tool, like grasshopper on Rhino. With the flexibility of web technology, to lay the foundation of a community that share, create, and enjoy richful graphics art with real world practice.
